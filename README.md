# Extracting-User-Journey-Data-Using-SQL-Project

SQL is often just used to fetch raw data from data storage that is later transferred to other software for preprocessing. But this programming language can do more than select data from a table. Sometimes, aggregating or preprocessing data in SQL directly might be easier or more beneficial—precisely the purpose of this project. This Extracting User Journey Data with SQL project centers around creating a customer journey data extract as the starting point for later analysis. Here, “user journey” refers to the steps each user goes through while exploring the product or platform before purchasing. The context is an online subscription-based company offering monthly, quarterly, and annual subscription plans.
